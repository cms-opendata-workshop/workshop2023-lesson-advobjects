title: "Jet substructure"
teaching: 30
exercises: 15
questions:
- "Which jet substructure observables are available in CMS MiniAOD?"
- "How are W boson jets identified using fat jets?"
- "How are top quark jets identified using fat jets?"
objectives:
- "Understand the groomed mass and jet substructure variables typically used in CMS analyses"
- "Study W boson and top quark identification"
keypoints:
- "Grooming algorithms remove soft and wide angle radiation to bring a jet's mass closer to that of the parent particle."
- "Substructure algorithms provide information about the number of high-momentum subjets or whether heavy flavor hadrons existed inside the jet."
- "The standard variables needed to tag W, Z, H boson or top quark jets in 2015 data are included in the POET."
